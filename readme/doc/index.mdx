# Stitches Tech Sample <br/><small>_by_ ‹div›RIOTS</small>

This is a _Technology Sample_ you can rely on to build your own Design System, based on [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/).

**Disclaimer**: _Technology Samples_ aren't comprehensive _Design Systems_ but showcases of a given technology and are itended to be used as a base for you to build your own solution on.

## Architecture

This _tech sample_ uses [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) to implement its components. Stitches is a CSS-in-JS tool, based on the [System UI](https://system-ui.com/) [Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme), allowing you to set tokens, themes, as well as extending them for your components and their variants.

### Tokens

The Tokens are split in different components, following the SystemUI [Theme Specification](https://system-ui.com/theme). They are then merged into a Stitches configuration in the `stitches` component.

## Documentation

Documentation pages are using the [@divriots/dockit-react](https://github.com/divriots/dockit-react) documentation framework to preview the different tokens and components. See the `layout` component.
